<h1>🔒⛓ Hello!</h1> <br />
♠️ We're Forged Evidence, a bodily adult, queer, fictive-heavy plural system. <br />
🔗 We collectively go by the name "Kristoph" and "he/him" pronouns. <br />
✨ Feel free to interact with us as long as you aren't trying to involve us with any kind of discourse. <br />
📫 Most of the time the skin we're using represents the current fronter, but <br />
❕ Not all of our skins are representing our headmates! If there's no "sys" tag, it's just a skin made purely for fun. <br />
⚡ Our sources: <i>Ace Attorney</i>, <i>Danganronpa</i>. <br />
💙 Cuddles are ok (especially if the media is shared)! But asking first is always welcome.
